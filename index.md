        The knowledge and impact of the internet and technology on society is greatly felt in the way that we think and act towards communication. For example, the telegraph was the first technological innovation that separated communication with transportation. Because communication could happen almost instantly, business transactions and messages increased the rate of production. According to James Carey in Technology and Ideology: The Case of the Telegraph, “ The most important fact about the telegraph is at once the most obvious and innocent: It permitted for the first time the effective separation of communication from transportation.” ( Carey 3) This ability was most largely felt in industrial and corporate industries, while also within local communities. The idea that a person on the east coast could communicate with a person on the west coast in a matter of minutes allowed for faster production because tasks and information could be relayed faster. 
         In local communities the telegraph affected the religious life because of the lack of physical material involved in the process of communication. The innovation was extremely advanced for the time and the knowledge and understanding of how electricity worked was very minimal. Quoting a Boston Reverend Carey says, “Electricity, the Reverend Ezra S. Gannett told his Boston congregation, was both the “swift winged messenger of destruction” and the “vital energy of material creation. The invisible, imponderable substance, force, whatever it be—we do not even certainly know what it is which we are dealing with.” (Carey 5) Personally when reading and thinking about how the internet and technology has influenced the way society treats communication, I realized my outlook in communication is incredibly provincial and different than my parents and grandparents. As human beings we seem to externally place importance on verbal communication and personal dialogue; however, we are often afraid to face a physical being when wanted to talk about something important and resort to technology to engage in discussion. The internet has provided a very superficial wall that people can hide behind and protect themselves with. 
          The understanding of the internet and its complexity by the vast majority of internet users is incredibly low. I too am one who is a frequent user of the internet with very little to none understanding of how it works or even where it came from. This lack of knowledge is the source of much frustration experienced by internet users that come across when trying to understand an issue he or she is having with the web. According to Paul Dourish in Not The Internet, but This Internet: How Othernets Illuminate Our Feudal Internet, “We need to take an approach to “the Internet” that begins with an understanding of its technical reality,... we want to maintain a focus on the social and cultural reality of technologies such as the Internet.” (Dourish 2) Because the internet is such a complex entity, understanding the basics is already a difficult task in and of itself, yet a proper understanding of the basics can lead for smarter innovation in the future with decreased frequency of issues with the internet.

	Surveillance capitalism is the act of websites and internet sites stealing data from the user that is on their site, and using it for feedback on the type of user that is visiting their site. Online purchasing has changed the game of marketing and drastically affects the way products are marketed, as well as the intended audiences of advertisements. The power that the internet holds in terms of being able to find out personal information about their clients is immensely underestimated. Because of the convenience and easy access online users are granted, there is an extreme lack of care of  their internet safety and identity. 
	This strongly relates to the complexity of the internet and the lack of knowledge of many internet users. Because there is such a lack of understanding of how the internet works, users  assume that their identity is safe, and they trust many of the websites that they are using. However, the terms and privacy of many websites are incredibly long and wordy, and have hidden loopholes in their terms that allow them to access personal information. All that is needed for permission to be granted to these websites is your approval through the clicking of a box. This happens to many internet users and is how accounts get hacked and information gets stolen. One specific way personal information is tracked is through the use of apps on smartphones. Many smartphone apps will require location services to be enabled along with access to camera, or at least make those features an option for enhanced use of the app. When discussing an example of an app tracking one of its users, Jennifer Valentino-Devries of the New York Times says, “An app on the device gathered her location information, which was then sold without her knowledge. It recorded her whereabouts as often as every two seconds, according to a database of more than a million phones in the New York area that was reviewed by The New York Times” (Valentino-Devries). Even without user’s permission, apps can track information if the terms and privacy policy is agreed to. Apps have the ability to track and receive personal and intimate details that one may not wish to have disclosed. Some companies state that the personal details of a person’s life is not the information they are looking for, rather they are looking for data that will help their marketing strategies. Although this is what companies may say, the information being received is still personal. App tracking and data tracking are incredibly sneaky and invasive ways personal information can be obtained, and app and internet users should be cautious of the apps and sites they visit in order to protect themselves.

My hyperlink project serves as a representation of me as a holistic person, and each image is significant of something I deem to be important to me. The hyper-text-self-portrait that I have created consists of three photos that in some way symbolize my values. The first photograph is a picture of me and my grandfather. The second photograph is quite literally a self-portrait as is the picture used for an identification card. The final photograph is a picture of myself in a football uniform. 
The first photograph of me and my grandfather symbolizes the importance of family and faith in my life. The photograph was taken following my Confirmation, which is a Catholic sacrament that symbolizes the entrance into Catholic Adulthood. I consider myself to be a practicing Catholic, and the Catholic standards and values are very similar to the standards and values I hold myself to. The reason I chose my grandfather to represent a picture of my family is because he is the rock of my family. He was a man who represents what it means to sacrifice for family and put his family before himself. Throughout my life I have always been taught that I am nothing without family, and family is the only thing that can consistently be counted on. 
The second photograph is the picture used on the identification card for my school. Although the image itself is not directly a representation of my education, the image is on a card that identifies me in my place of education. Education has always been of utmost importance to me because I believe education leads to opportunities and success. I also believe that education leads to a better world and a less impoverished world. Therefore, the more educated the world is as a whole, the safer and smarter place it will be. I also understand that the access to education I have had has been an absolute privilege. I do not take this privilege for granted at all which is why education is incredibly important to me. 
The third photograph of myself in a football uniform represents the importance of sports, specifically football, in my life. Football has played an extremely important and influential role to me and my family. I have played football for as long as I can remember, and it has provided me with opportunities to express my talents and attend the school of my dreams. Football is something that my family loves and has dictated the circumstances of my intermediate families life in the recent past. My brother plays in the NFL, and without him, my family would not be in the stable situation we are in today.  
The creation of this hyper-link-self-portrait reminded me of an article written by Maria J. Bates in which she discusses berrypicking. According to Bates, berrypicking can be understood as, “a new model of searching in online and other information systems.” (Bates 1) The article describes berrypicking as a complex way of researching on the internet. The paths to which we receive information is not from point A to B, but rather a system of retrieval using many different pathways. I feel as if I witnessed this and struggled with this very concept in the making of the self-portrait.

	There are many difficult tasks that are involved with working and operating a webpage, and the people that are successful and completing these tasks are not compensated with what they deserve. There are people with a job similar to that of a construction worker or handyman when it comes to technology. This person will add text to websites, read just the design, make sure URLs are accurate, make sure the settings are updated to the latest software, etc. The people that are able to do these jobs are often scarce because the difficulty of the job. Even though there are not many people who can accomplish these tasks, the pay wage varies based on what the company or corporation wants to pay and how bad they need it. Another aspect of this job that increases the level of difficulty is working in accordance with the privacy terms of each website. Sometimes changing to much and accessing what one is not supposed violates a user agreement which can lead to a shutdown of the job. According to Mary Gray of the Los Angeles Times, “Such policies are not unique to AMT. Using Terms of Service and Participation Agreements as guidance for when — or whether — to pay people for work they have satisfactorily completed is standard practice in the crowdworking sphere.” The treatment and attitude towards these workers also needs to change. Their work is seen as merely a convenience, and the work and difficulty is not understood and appreciated. This is also what leads to the inconsistent wages of the services provided by crowdwork sites. Working for a crowdwork site can be discouraging and unpleasant a lot of the time because of the lack of respect for their jobs. There are no benefit plans, consistent wages, and infrastructure for the workers of crowdwork sites. The only thing that can lead to change the items listed above is a change in perception of the work done. 
	The lack of respect and appreciation for the work done by people like Khan bewilders me. These people provide services that are incredibly necessary to the success and advancement of many sites. However, because there is a lack of knowledge about how the internet works, there is a lack of appreciation for the work done. Without the work of crowdwork sites, companies would find it incredibly difficult to fix the issues of their internet pages. The biggest issue is the lack of compensation and consistent benefits for these workers. Their work is valuable and vital to the success of many websites, and it should be shown through their wages and benefits.

Speculative Future Proposal: A New Los Angeles

The city of Los Angeles as it stands today is a bustling metropolis with many inefficiencies. The transportation industry has never been larger, and the ways in which people get from point A to point B are slow and inefficient. Our proposal for the future of this great city has everything to do with utilizing the three dimensions of space that we live in to make travelling a safer and more expedited experience. Current means of inter and intra-city travel use mostly two dimensional roadways to satisfy transport needs. This leads to traffic and dangerous situations for the roadways’ users. Our proposition will mitigate these issues while freeing up space within the city for other activities. 
With the future of transportation in Los Angeles involving designated roads for particular populations, we have decided to designate current state roads, interstates, highways, and main roads to commercial transportation only. Big rigs and automobiles that are used to transport commercial goods and services will be the only people allowed to use the roads mentioned above. We have decided to only allow for commercial transportation on these roads because given the current infrastructure we have for transportation, it would be incredibly difficult and inefficient to force commercial automobiles to use a different set of roads. Many stores, warehouses, and any building with some sort of port has created a system for ground transportation only, and this system has worked efficiently. What will be considered “commercial transportation” will be big rigs, cars delivering goods to a store or home, or cars with people delivering a service to a home. For example, UPS, FedEX, mail deliveries, and any other deliveries of that type will be allowed to use main roads and interstates to deliver their goods and services. Big rigs carrying store goods and food products will be able to use these roads to travel from the Los Angeles Port to whatever store it may need to go to. Plumbers and construction workers will also be able to use these roads when they are on duty and delivering their services to a customer. If one is not going to deliver a commercial good or service then access to interstates, highways, and main roads will be denied. Restricting who can access these roads will decrease traffic and increase transportation rate. The population size on the road will be much smaller and there will be less opportunity for collisions and traffic jams. Because traffic will be decreased the rate at which goods and services can be delivered will increase, thus allowing for more goods and services to occur. Overall, the idea is to designate specific roads for specific populations. As stated before, the purpose for keeping and allowing commercial transportation on the current interstates, highways, and main roads is because of the current infrastructure we have for commercial transportation. One might be wondering where other automobiles and forms of transportation might take place. If interstates, highways, and main roads are restricted to commercial transportation, what other roads will be used for people to travel within the city? We have decided to take transportation to the next level, quite literally. 
An important aspect to reducing traffic in L.A. will be reducing surface congestion. The three dimensional world that we live in allows for us to use more than one plain, this is especially important when discussing the topic of traffic. Currently all of the intercity transportation in L.A. is on one plain which is the ground level. Expanding public transportation downward will reduce the traffic on the surface significantly, because it will attract people to the new avenues of transportation. As well, using the depths of the earth allows for near infinite levels of travel. There could be more than 100 layers of different transportation avenues. Public intercity transportation is necessary to reduce traffic. The first underground level would be a network of new roads designated for public transit. Buses and other means of public transportation are effective at getting people anywhere in a reasonable amount of time. By giving these modes of transportation more of a priority it will attract more people to use them and reduce traffic. For how heavily populated L.A. is the fact that the subway system is so poor  is astounding. The second layer of transportation would be made of vacuum chambers that use electromagnetic force to quickly transport people within the city. This technology is similar to that of railguns, By using a series of magnets whole containers of people could be accelerated to their destination extremely quickly. This would offer people another efficient alternative for intercity travel and would reduce the necessity for a car clearing up space on the surface. The levels below would be for those wishing to travel to further destinations. Here there would be a great number of layers of hyperloops. These loops are created in vacuum tubes to reduce friction and would be able to transport people across great distances. This would be a great aid to people commuting greater than average distances. As well as offer an alternative to planes. LAX airport is the fourth largest airport in the world, it has an average of 1,700 flights a day. Offering another option would greatly reduce the use of this airport and in turn would affect all of the traffic in L.A.The biggest key to all of this is to use the 3D space presented. There are so many possibilities to be explored using this simple concept.
	One of the most prevalent issues that the city of LA currently faces is the traffic associated with the daily commute. Our version of Los Angeles will completely eliminate this issue and has multiple other benefits. Sticking with our theme, new roadways will be taking greater advantage of the three dimensional  space within the city. Even in a heavily built up city like Los Angeles, There is a plethora of unused space that should be utilized.  The movie Tomorrowland depicts a similar proposition, in that the roads are built above ground, supported by concrete columns. What we are proposing is similar, but more extreme. New roads will exist in a network that runs through the city while being up to a couple hundred feet off the ground. They will be able to be supported by the buildings and other infrastructure surrounding them, and will run throughout the cities most populated spaces.These new roadways will eliminate the need for much of the existing roadway infrastructure, meaning that the existing ground based roads can be repurposed as well. Commuters within the city will be relying almost solely on these air roads as their means of personal transportation to and from work and other daily activities. These roads, however, come at the expense of an increased safety hazard because of their position off the ground. As a result, the only vehicles able to travel on these roadways will be fully autonomous automobiles. This network of self-driving cars will essentially exists within the framework of a large ride-sharing platform. Someone needing to go to work will request a car and give their destination, and one will arrive to the nearest location to take them there. This solves many problems associated with current day commuting and self-driving technology. This network of cars will be able to communicate with one another to determine the quickest and most efficient routes to their destinations. Without humans at the wheel, traffic will not become an issue, and the chances of a mental error leading to an accident are non-existent. The roadways on which these cars will travel on will also solve issues of ethicality relating to the decision making power of a fully-automated car. These roads will not be running through residential areas or have sidewalks lining them, therefore the chances of a threat existing outside of the network of cars will be close to zero. This method of transport will be catered towards the daily commuters, but will be able to be utilized by anyone within the city to get wherever they may need. This is a yet another way we can better utilize the space within the city, but what about using the sky?
An element we envision for the future of transportation in LA is air-bourne transportation. As previously mentioned, traffic could be improved if we start to take advantage of the 3-Dimensional world we live in. That would include some advanced technology permitting flying ride-share. We propose that as technology continues to make leaps in the future, what seems to be a fictional idea can become a reality. If at least 10% of travel in LA could be transferred from the streets to the air we would already see a great change in the traffic issue that currently exists. In order for this idea to succeed it would require a great deal of reliability and convenience to the consumer. Flying ride-share could be very intimidating to many. I would imagine a lot of people questioning it’s safety and dependability. Another question could be convenience. Where and when would people board these air-born rides? We propose that these flying ride-share systems would be able to function the same way ride sharing does today on the roads. For the most convenient experience consumers would be more likely to utilize a flying ride-share if it was capable of going straight to their front door. In order to ensure safety demands those who pilot these ride shares would have to be extremely well qualified. Having passed several background checks and meeting certain qualification standards any citizen above the age of 25 could operate them. Not only would this relieve traffic, it would also improve the job market and provide even more possibilities for the average citizen to participate in the community of Los Angeles. Flying ride-share could be an intimidating idea at first, but if executed properly could dramatically improve the landscape of the city.
With improvements and changes in the way transportation is done In LA, it can open our creative eyes onto the worn down parts of the city. Due to the amount of people living in LA and constant action and activity in the downtown area, large parking structures seem to be common all over the city. Their purpose has always been to organize and help drivers find place to position themselves close to their destinations.  Although these buildings are designed to help solve the traffic and constant automobile transportation, they also create their own problems and, at times, make the situation worse. There is difficulty for divers to find spaces to park in these structures because they are often crowded and because of the close quarters within them, drives are more susceptible to get in small accidents. Another issue with parking garages is how their size impacts the real estate in the city. Time and time again we see large, open areas of space in LA be used for parking what they really should be used for more valuable things. Ultimately,  parking garages eat up space and do more damage to the transportation system in. LA then we think. However, with our proposal for not only autonomous cars, but other advanced ideas of transportation in LA, large scale parking garages could become a thing of the past. Many people believe that the rise in totally autonomous car will start to shift how large scale parking lots and structures are used within cities like LA. With the use of autonomous vehicles, parking becomes less of a problem because these vehicles will be able to take up less space and still get people to the place they need to be. Vehicles that can pick up and drop off people in their destination make parking simpler than how it is in our modern time. Because most cars will be autonomous in the future and will be able to take up less space during their commutes, we will no longer have need for large spaces for parking. In place of these buildings, we propose that they are replaced with things that will be more people friendly and socially attractive. Weather its new parks, housing buildings, malls or schools, the possibilities are endless as to what can be put in place of these parking spaces. With simplified parking, parking garage spaces can be used for other purposes that will ultimately better the quality of LA. 

The future of Los Angeles according to our plan is a safer and more efficient environment for all. The forms of transportation that will exist will make this city a more enjoyable place to live and will free up space for more outdoor activities.
