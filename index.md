        The knowledge and impact of the internet and technology on society is greatly felt in the way that we think and act towards communication. For example, the telegraph was the first technological innovation that separated communication with transportation. Because communication could happen almost instantly, business transactions and messages increased the rate of production. According to James Carey in Technology and Ideology: The Case of the Telegraph, “ The most important fact about the telegraph is at once the most obvious and innocent: It permitted for the first time the effective separation of communication from transportation.” ( Carey 3) This ability was most largely felt in industrial and corporate industries, while also within local communities. The idea that a person on the east coast could communicate with a person on the west coast in a matter of minutes allowed for faster production because tasks and information could be relayed faster. 
         In local communities the telegraph affected the religious life because of the lack of physical material involved in the process of communication. The innovation was extremely advanced for the time and the knowledge and understanding of how electricity worked was very minimal. Quoting a Boston Reverend Carey says, “Electricity, the Reverend Ezra S. Gannett told his Boston congregation, was both the “swift winged messenger of destruction” and the “vital energy of material creation. The invisible, imponderable substance, force, whatever it be—we do not even certainly know what it is which we are dealing with.” (Carey 5) Personally when reading and thinking about how the internet and technology has influenced the way society treats communication, I realized my outlook in communication is incredibly provincial and different than my parents and grandparents. As human beings we seem to externally place importance on verbal communication and personal dialogue; however, we are often afraid to face a physical being when wanted to talk about something important and resort to technology to engage in discussion. The internet has provided a very superficial wall that people can hide behind and protect themselves with. 
          The understanding of the internet and its complexity by the vast majority of internet users is incredibly low. I too am one who is a frequent user of the internet with very little to none understanding of how it works or even where it came from. This lack of knowledge is the source of much frustration experienced by internet users that come across when trying to understand an issue he or she is having with the web. According to Paul Dourish in Not The Internet, but This Internet: How Othernets Illuminate Our Feudal Internet, “We need to take an approach to “the Internet” that begins with an understanding of its technical reality,... we want to maintain a focus on the social and cultural reality of technologies such as the Internet.” (Dourish 2) Because the internet is such a complex entity, understanding the basics is already a difficult task in and of itself, yet a proper understanding of the basics can lead for smarter innovation in the future with decreased frequency of issues with the internet.

Weblog #2

My hyperlink project serves as a representation of me as a holistic person, and each image is significant of something I deem to be important to me. The hyper-text-self-portrait that I have created consists of three photos that in some way symbolize my values. The first photograph is a picture of me and my grandfather. The second photograph is quite literally a self-portrait as is the picture used for an identification card. The final photograph is a picture of myself in a football uniform. 
The first photograph of me and my grandfather symbolizes the importance of family and faith in my life. The photograph was taken following my Confirmation, which is a Catholic sacrament that symbolizes the entrance into Catholic Adulthood. I consider myself to be a practicing Catholic, and the Catholic standards and values are very similar to the standards and values I hold myself to. The reason I chose my grandfather to represent a picture of my family is because he is the rock of my family. He was a man who represents what it means to sacrifice for family and put his family before himself. Throughout my life I have always been taught that I am nothing without family, and family is the only thing that can consistently be counted on. 
The second photograph is the picture used on the identification card for my school. Although the image itself is not directly a representation of my education, the image is on a card that identifies me in my place of education. Education has always been of utmost importance to me because I believe education leads to opportunities and success. I also believe that education leads to a better world and a less impoverished world. Therefore, the more educated the world is as a whole, the safer and smarter place it will be. I also understand that the access to education I have had has been an absolute privilege. I do not take this privilege for granted at all which is why education is incredibly important to me. 
The third photograph of myself in a football uniform represents the importance of sports, specifically football, in my life. Football has played an extremely important and influential role to me and my family. I have played football for as long as I can remember, and it has provided me with opportunities to express my talents and attend the school of my dreams. Football is something that my family loves and has dictated the circumstances of my intermediate families life in the recent past. My brother plays in the NFL, and without him, my family would not be in the stable situation we are in today.  
The creation of this hyper-link-self-portrait reminded me of an article written by Maria J. Bates in which she discusses berrypicking. According to Bates, berrypicking can be understood as, “a new model of searching in online and other information systems.” (Bates 1) The article describes berrypicking as a complex way of researching on the internet. The paths to which we receive information is not from point A to B, but rather a system of retrieval using many different pathways. I feel as if I witnessed this and struggled with this very concept in the making of the self-portrait.
